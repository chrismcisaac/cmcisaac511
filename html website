 <h2> "America's favoirte pastime" </h2>
 <p>
    The first official game of baseball was played in 1846. The teams were the Knickerbockers and a cricket team. 30 years later, in 1871, the first professional baseball association was formed, and then in 1876 it became the national league. The american league was then formed in 1900. Winning the World Series is the ultimate goal for any professional baseball team, the first world series was played in 1903 between the Boston Americans and the Pittsburgh Pirates in a best of 9 series. The Boston Americans ended up winning the series 5 games to 3. Major League baseball used to be an all white sport until April 15, 1947 when Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier by joining the Brooklyn Dodgers. Since then, baseball has become a very diverse sport with it's best ballplayers coming from all over the world.

 <h2> Rules of the Game </h2>
 <p>
     In a game there are nine innings, each inning is split into two halves, the top half, and the bottom half. During the top half of the inning, the home team is in the field and then they will bat in the bottom half. When someone is up to bat and they get 3 strikes, they will be out. A strike is when the batter either misses the ball or hits the ball in foul territory. However, if the batter has two strikes and they hit a foul ball, they will continue to bat until they either miss, hit the ball in play, or walk. A walk is when the pitcher throws 4 pitches that are outside the imaginary strike zone and the batter doesnt swing. When the team on defense gets three outs, the teams will switch sides and then they will be up at bat.
